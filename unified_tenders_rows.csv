USAID's approach to gender analysis is built around two key questions: (1) how will the different roles and status of women and men within the community, political sphere, workplace, and household (for example, roles in decision-making and different access to and control over resources and services) affect the work to be undertaken? And, (2) how will the anticipated results of the work affect women and men differently?<br /><br />USAID anticipates awarding multiple contracts as a result of this solicitation. The solicitation will be set-aside for small businesses only. Small businesses may want to consider joint ventures or partnerships with other businesses. Further, small businesses may consider subcontracting with large businesses as long as the small business performs a minimum of 50% of the work. Interested small businesses should review and understand the requirements in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 19 and clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.<br /><br />There is no guarantee on the number of contracts to be awarded, or the amount of money each firm is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount to be stated in the RFP. USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $74,000,000 over the five year ordering period. The ceiling dollar value applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate.<br /><br />The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (http://www.fbo.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only.

Also please pay attention that if the EoI is provided by a joint venture, each member 
of the joint venture must meet at least the following portion of requirements independently:  
1. In case of 1 partner in JV - 60% for the Leader and 40% for the Partner  
2. In case of 2 partners in JV - 60% for the Leader and 20% for  each Partner  
3. In case of 3 partners in JV - 40% for the Leader and 20% for each Partner  
Key Experts will not be assessed during the shortlisting stage. 
Note:  It  is  noted  that  in  order  to  carry  out  the  expected  services,  the  Consultant,  its 
local  partner  or  specialized  sub-consultant  will  need  to  provide  compliance  of  design 
documentation with  local  design  standards prepared  by  the  Consultant  during  the  project 
implementation. Also, having a license from the Ministry of Construction of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan for design activities is an advantage during implementation, but not a requirement. 
The attention of interested Consultants is drawn to Section 2, paragraphs 2.3.5 of the 
AIIB Procurement Instructions for Recipients setting forth the Bank’s policy on conflict of 
interest. Consultants  can  partner  with  other  firms  in  a  joint  venture  to  enhance  their 
qualifications.  In  the  case  of  a  joint  venture  (JV),  all  members  of  the  JV  will  be  assessed 
separately for shortlisting purposes and are jointly and severally liable for the assignment and 
sign the contract if the JV contract is awarded. 
Interested consultants should clearly indicate the structure of their association and the 
responsibilities  of  partners  and  sub-consultants  in  their  proposal.  A  vague  definition  of 
expressions of interest using terms such as “in common with” and / or “in affiliation with”, 
etc., may result in not being considered for shortlisting. While maintaining the principle of 
one expression of interest for the firm, the consulting firm can decide whether it wishes to 
participate as a sub-consultant, or as a stand-alone consultant, or as a partner in a joint venture. 
Note, that a firm must submit only one EoI in one selection process, either independently as 
a  consultant  or  as  a  partner  in  a  joint  venture.  No  firm  can  submit  a  proposal  as  a  sub-
consultant  in  one  and  an  independent  participant  in  another  EoI.  A  firm,  acting  as  a  sub-
consultant to any EOI, may participate in more than one EOI, but only as a sub-consultant. 
The experience of the sub-consultant will not count towards the shortlisting. 
Expressions  of  interest  must  be  delivered  in  electronic  or  paper  form  by  16:00 
(Tashkent time) March 03, 2025 to the address below. Late applications will not be accepted. 

 
*OFFICIAL USE ONLY 
The  EoI  must be  prepared in  English. Expressions  of  interest  must  be  clearly  labelled  as 
“Development of a detailed design for construction works of water supply system.”
